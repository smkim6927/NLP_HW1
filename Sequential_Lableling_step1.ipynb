    "#  Sequential Labeling Input Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential labeling is a form of most of the problems to obtain special information in natural languages we use, such as Korean and English, and is a representative problem to solve symbols with abstract meaning in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data consisting of arbitrary symbols and labels are provided to verify the ability to construct a model for the format of the problem, rather than solving it with analysis of special domain-specific knowledge or qualities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It verifies the ability to implement a method of configuring a model to receive sequential input of symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-Hot Representation\n",
    "2. Trainable Word Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "1. The one-hot representation gives one symbol the only numeric ID, has only 1 value corresponding to that ID, and the rest is expressed as a vector with 0. The maximum length per symbol has a set maximum length that is used in the training set or larger in dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One-hot consists of vectors with continuous values in small dimensions, as the maximum length increases with more vocabulary. In addition, inputs with similar information are learned so that they can be gathered. For learning, we put vectors representing symbols as a set of model parameters and learn dictionaries like network parameters by connecting parameters according to the symbol's ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, test data is used the same as learning data to exclude verification of the model's generalization technology.\n",
    " * train set: simple_seq.train.csv\n",
    " * test set: simple_seq.test.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: Sequential Symbol (sequence, different length.)\n",
    "Output: Class label\n",
    "\n",
    "Input and output refer to objects that should be put in observational information from the perspective of the model and objects that should be predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed hyper-parameters.\n",
    "* Number of class label : 19\n",
    "* Input max length : 20\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Each line of the learning data file represents one input observation information and output label information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, all symbols starting with 'W' in the following samples are inputs. Class label that symbol starting with 'D' should predict.\n",
